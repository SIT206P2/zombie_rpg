Built using only HTML5, CSS3, JS, and JQuery and compiled for iOS native using Apache Cordova. Designed with object oriented programming in mind from the start to allow for flexibility and expandability.


Just one character and one zombie or two types, in which player and zombie take turns. One tile per move and one hit kill.

Player controls by clicking on tile around character. zombie moves randomly but attacks player if it's one tile away.

Game ends when either player or all zombie is dead.


Addition of player insanity, reduced by being near and interacting with zombies. If sanity reaches 0, game over. Addition of multiple zombies levels, each with different tasks:

1) First level: Kill monsters (only Shoggoths, no Elders)

2) Second level: Find Elder Sign (only Shoggoths, no Elders)

3) Third level: Kill Elder and any Shoggoths (one Elder)
